# Copper Rings
A Fabric mod that adds copper rings for bonus effects on the player

## I WILL NOT MAKE A FORGE PORT
But I will backport to other fabric versions if anybody asks, altough it's not a priority for me

You're welcome to do your own port if you want to

### Getting Started
In order to craft your first ring you'll, of course, need a shank to place your beautiful gems on
You can craft it like so:

After that just place a shank and a block in a crafting grid and you're done!

###### Note:
The rings will have totally different effects in the new versions, as i think i figured out how to apply status effects from the game when you wear them.
Therefore enjoy the basic and totally unbalanced rings while they last
